              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# ngeodesic

**Geometry-First AI Reasoning Engine**  
_Shapes latent geometry to suppress hallucinations and stabilize multi-step plans._

---

## Why ngeodesic?

Modern LLMs are great at language but drift under pressure. **ngeodesic** adds a geometry-first reasoning layer that treats model latents like a physical system:

- **Warp** the manifold to a single dominant “well” (funnel)  
- **Detect** true signals with matched filters + statistically calibrated nulls  
- **Denoise** phantom wells with hybrid smoothing, inhibition guards, and jitter averaging

Use it as a standalone parser/validator or pair it with a small **micro-LLM sidecar** (e.g., for DeFi, ARC-like tasks, coding, or tool plans, etc.).

---

## Install

```bash
# Core (lightweight)
pip install ngeodesic==0.0.2a1

# With optional extras
pip install "ngeodesic[ml]"      # scikit-learn: PCA/whitening
pip install "ngeodesic[viz]"     # matplotlib/scipy: plots
pip install "ngeodesic[dev]"     # pytest, ruff, mypy, etc.
```

Python ≥ 3.10 recommended.

---

## Quickstart

```python
import numpy as np
from ngeodesic.core.denoise import TemporalDenoiser
from ngeodesic.core.parser import geodesic_parse_report  # Stage-10/11 parser
from ngeodesic.core.matched_filter import half_sine_proto

# Example: parse a few synthetic residual traces (one per primitive channel)
rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
n, T = 3, 160
traces = [np.clip(rng.normal(0, 0.3, T) + (i==1)*np.sin(np.linspace(0, np.pi, T)), -2, 2)
          for i in range(n)]

# Detect & order candidate primitives
keep_mask, order = geodesic_parse_report(traces, sigma=9, proto_width=64)

# Optional: smooth a confidence series
den = TemporalDenoiser(mode="hybrid", ema_decay=0.85, median_k=3)
smoothed = den.smooth(np.array([0.1, 0.4, 0.8, 0.6, 0.7], dtype=float))

print("Detected:", keep_mask, "Order:", order)
```

> Tip: In LLM workflows, feed `traces` from a stable hidden-state “tap” (e.g., layer −9, last-k tokens). The parser/denoiser is model-agnostic.

---

## Core ideas (1-minute tour)

- **Warp**: Project latents to PCA(3), fit a radial **funnel** profile, and compute curvature/depth metrics.  
- **Detect**: Build per-primitive residual channels, run a **unimodal matched filter**, gate with dual thresholds (relative vs best channel, absolute vs **null** from circular shifts or permutations).  
- **Denoise**: Hybrid EMA+median smoothing, **phantom-guard** local probes, and **jitter averaging** to enforce stable, repeatable decisions.

---

## API overview

```python
# Parser / detection
from ngeodesic.core.parser import (
    stock_parse,                  # simple baseline
    geodesic_parse_report,        # Stage-10 parser
    geodesic_parse_with_prior,    # Stage-11 (optional priors/funnel)
)

# Funnel & warp
from ngeodesic.core.pca_warp import pca3_and_warp
from ngeodesic.core.funnel_profile import (
    fit_radial_profile, analytic_core_template, priors_from_profile
)

# Denoising & guards
from ngeodesic.core.denoise import TemporalDenoiser, phantom_guard, snr_db

# Sidecar (micro-LLM hooks)
from ngeodesic.sidecar.hooks import ModelHooks   # Protocol interface
from ngeodesic.sidecar.runner import Runner      # Minimal loop runner
```

---

## Typical LLM pattern

1. **Encode** a prompt/context with `output_hidden_states=True` (e.g., GPT-2-medium).  
2. **Tap** a stable layer (e.g., −9), slice the last-k tokens (e.g., 160).  
3. **Detect** candidate primitives with `geodesic_parse_report(...)`.  
4. **Denoise/guard** to suppress phantoms and late flips.  
5. **Execute** confirmed steps in your domain layer (e.g., DeFiPy, ARC primitives, tool calls).

---


## Status & roadmap

- **Status:** pre-release `0.1.0a1` (APIs stabilizing; tests/docs in progress).  
- **Next:** finalize `parser.py` Stage-11 path, add DeFi synthetic generator, and ship examples.  
- **Micro-LLM research:** lives in a separate fast-iteration repo; hardened pieces will fold back here as `ngeodesic.micro.*`.
